Hello, my name is Samuel Lord, and this is my Node.JS testing ground and portfolio.  I am a fan of FOSS, VB.NET, Node.JS/JS, HTML, ROBLOX LUA, Panda3D (even if I am just beginning), and CSS. I have Autism and some signs of ADHD.

## Why do I do what I do?
I program because I find it fun to create programs and to create solutions with said programs! Sometimes, I even program just for fun! Basically: I really like programming just to solve issues and have fun doing what I love!

## Do you enjoy programming?
Very much so, but sometimes I get quite frustrated at not being able to solve errors with the code, but it's OK.
